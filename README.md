# Quantum Deep Dreams
We exploit the quantum Hilbert space, entanglement, and superposition to reveal undiscovered interesting properties in given videos and compose them in a quantum-intuitively aesthetically pleasing manner, creating a “deep dream experience”.
## Features
- Encoding into superposition and entanglement between color and object-number-properties computed from source videos and rotation of states around the Bloch sphere according to those values (Python + OpenCV)
- Superposition and entanglement-based distribution of video opacities over time (Qiskit)
- Dynamic allocation of opacities between set points, allowing for smooth transition of opacity (Python)
- Layering of translucent frames on top of each other, and concatenation of related clips (MoviePy)
